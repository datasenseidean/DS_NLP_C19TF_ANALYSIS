    "Listening to various tv shows, there seems to be a debate about President Trump having a change in tone about COVID-19. As you flip through channels and scroll social media posts, you can find perspectives on both sides of the argument. \n",

    "The answers to the following quesitons will provide the required information to acheive the primary and secondary goals: \n",
    "- What is the current overall sentiment?\n",
    "- How has it changed from the beginning of this crisis in the U.S.?\n",
    "- What specific sentences could be percieved negatively?\n",
    "- What specific sentences could be pervieved positively?"
