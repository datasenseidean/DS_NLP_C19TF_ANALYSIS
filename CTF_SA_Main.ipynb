      "I just had a meeting with Kevin McCarthy, future Speaker of the House, I hope. And he’s done a fantastic job for the people of California. And also, the people of California have done a fantastic job, when you look at the — at the bump. You take a look at the bump and how they’re doing out there. So I congratulate everybody out there.Thank you.  Great job you’re doing.Thank you.  You go ahead.  I’ll talk to you later. Okay, thank you very much, everybody.  And I want to start by saying that our hearts go out to the people of New York as they bear the brunt of the coronavirus pandemic in America.  That seems to be the hotspot right now.  But you have some others, as you know, that are very — very bad.  Very bad.  Louisiana is getting hit very hard.  Parts of Michigan are getting hit very, very hard.  New Jersey is — is –surprisingly, it’s much greater than anybody would have thought.  They’re doing a really good job.  The governor is doing a really good job out there.\n",
      "\n",
      "New York’s first responders, EMTs, doctors, nurses are showing incredible courage under pressure.  They’re the best in the world.  We will take every action and we’ll spare no resource — financial, medical, scientific.  We will not spare anything.  We’ll get it back into shape.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Empire State — the governor is doing an excellent job.  They’re all working very hard together.  At the request of the governor, as you know, the Javits Center, we have 2,500 beds, and we’re going to allow that to be a system where this horrible disease can be looked after, the patients can be looked after.  That was going to be for regular medical problems such as accidents.  And, you know, it’s very interesting, the governor is telling me we don’t have too many accidents and very few people driving.\n",
      "\n",
      "So we’re going to put that facility into play, which is a big facility.  The ship will be staying the way it is, but we’re putting that facility into play to help them.\n",
      "\n",
      "And today, also, the CDC is announcing additional steps Americans can take to defend against the transmission of the virus.  From recent studies, we know that the transmission from individuals without symptoms is playing a more significant role in the spread of the virus than previously understood.  So you don’t seem to have symptoms and it still gets transferred.\n",
      "\n",
      "In light of these studies, the CDC is advising the use of non-medical cloth face covering as an additional voluntary public health measure.  So it’s voluntary; you don’t have to do it.  They suggested for a period of time.  But this is voluntary.  I don’t think I’m going to be doing it.\n",
      "\n",
      "But you have a lot of ways — you can look at it as follows: The CDC is recommending that Americans wear a basic cloth or a fabric mask that can be either purchased online or simply made at home.  Probably material that you’d have at home.  These face coverings can be easily washed or reused.\n",
      "\n",
      "I want to emphasize that the CDC is not recommending the use of medical-grade or surgical-grade masks, and we want that to be used for our great medical people that are working so hard and doing some job.  Medical protective gear must be reserved for the frontline healthcare workers who are performing those vital services.\n",
      "\n",
      "The new mask guidelines also do not replace CDC’s guidance on social distancing, including staying in your home when possible, standing at least six feet apart for a period of time.  Again, we’re going to all come back together here.  We’re going to all come back together.  And practicing hand hygiene, which we should do anyway.\n",
      "\n",
      "A lot of things, I think, are going to spill over.  Shaking hands maybe will stay with our country for a long time beyond this.  One of the — one of our great doctors was telling me that — as you know, we have flus every year, and the number of people killed by the flu is very substantial.  And said that if they didn’t shake hands, that number would be substantially lower.  So maybe it’ll stay.  Maybe some of these things, long term, will be good.  But those guidelines are still the best and the safest way to avoid the infection.\n",
      "\n",
      "So with the masks, it’s going to be, really, a voluntary thing.  You can do it.  You don’t have to do it.  I’m choosing not to do it, but some people may want to do it, and that’s okay.  It may be good.  Probably will.  They’re making a recommendation.  It’s only a recommendation.  It’s voluntary.\n",
      "\n",
      "We’re also taking action to ensure the cost of no barrier to any American seeking testing or treatment of the coronavirus.  The largest insurer nationwide, the BlueCross BlueShield System, has now announced that it will not require any co-pays — which is really something; that’s a tremendous statement — from patients of the virus treatment for the next 60 days, similar to the commitments of Cigna, Humana, Anthem.  Those are great companies, and they’re all doing the same thing.  So, co-pays.  For them to do that is — it’s a big statement.  We appreciate it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Today I can so proudly announce that hospitals and healthcare providers treating uninsured coronavirus patients will be reimbursed by the federal government using funds from the economic relief package Congress passed last month.  So that was as per the question yesterday and actually the day before yesterday.  This should alleviate any concern uninsured Americans may have about seeking the coronavirus treatment.  So that’s, I think, answers the question pretty well and very much in the favor of our great people.\n",
      "\n",
      "I’m also signing a directive invoking the Defense Production Act to prohibit export of scarce health and medical supplies by unscrupulous actors and profiteers.\n",
      "\n",
      "The security and Secretary — the Secretary of Homeland Security will work with FEMA to prevent the export of N95 respirators, surgical masks, gloves, and other personal protective equipment.  We need these items immediately for domestic use.  We have to have them.  But we’ve done really well with the purchase of items, and you’ll be hearing about that shortly.\n",
      "\n",
      "We’ve already leveraged the DPA to stop the hoarding and price gouging of crucial supplies.  Under that authority, this week, the Department of Health and Human Services, working with the Department of Justice, took custody of nearly 200,000 N95 respirators, 130,000 surgical masks, 600,000 gloves, as well as bottles — many, many, many bottles — and disinfectant sprays that were being hoarded.  All of this material is now being given to healthcare workers.  Most of it has already been given out.  And we’ve given a lot to New York, a lot in New Jersey, a lot to other places.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to ensure that healthcare workers in New York have the protective equipment they need, the federal government, in the name of the Department of Defense, is providing about 8.1 million N95 respirators.  Department of Defense.  And we’ve already given 200,000 of them to New York City.  Mayor de Blasio needed them very badly, so we got them to Mayor de Blasio in New York City.  And they were very grateful.  8.1 million.  And we’re going to be increasing that number from 8.1 million to more.  That’s a lot of N95 respirators.\n",
      "\n",
      "Today, my team spoke with the CEO of Ochsner Health and the CEO of LCMC, the two largest health systems in New Orleans.  They said they feel that they currently have enough ventilators — I think a lot of people are going to have enough ventilators — and masks, and appreciate what we did and all of the things we’ve been doing with them, working with them.\n",
      "\n",
      "The CEO of Ochsner, Warner Thomas — who’s really been fantastic, I have to say — indicated a need for 230,000 surgical gowns.  And I instructed FEMA to deliver them tomorrow.  So they’ll have the 230,000.  That’s Louisiana — New Orleans.  Two hundred and thirty thousand surgical gowns; they’ll have them by tomorrow.\n",
      "\n",
      "We’re expanding the role of the armed forces in our response effort because no one is better prepared to win a war than the United States military.  And we are in a war.  The invisible enemy — remember.\n",
      "\n",
      "Over 9,000 retired Army medical personnel have answered their nation’s call and are now supporting field hospitals and medical facilities all across the country, like what I just told you, that Governor Cuomo requested we do something in Javits, where we take it over.  And we’re going to have that manned by the military, because it’s very tough to get people — more people in the New York area.  So we’re going to have it manned by the military — Javits Center.\n",
      "\n",
      "National Guard members have been activated to help states build new treatment centers and assist in the seamless distribution of medical supplies.  That includes National Guard.  The National Guard is assisting very strongly because the states were, in many cases, unable to have the delivery capability from warehouses and other places that we put the supplies.  So I’ve given approval to use the National Guards — the various National Guards in the different states.  And they’re doing a fantastic job of not only protecting people but delivering material.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Army Corps of Engineers has assessed more than 100 facilities in all 50 states and is rapidly building temporary hospitals and alternative care sites in many states: in New York, New Jersey, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Illinois, New Mexico, Oregon, Washington Wisconsin, Ohio.  They’re doing a lot of work in just those states, plus additionals, that are being — will be announced probably tomorrow.  But they’re doing some job.  The Army Corps of Engineers — what a job they’re doing.  And FEMA — what a job they’re doing.\n",
      "\n",
      "As we deploy the power of our military, we’re also deploying the skill of our doctors, scientists, and medical researchers.  We continue to study the effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine and other therapies, and the treatment and prevention of the virus.  And we will keep the American people fully informed on our findings.  Hydroxychloroquine — I don’t know, it’s looking like it’s having some good results.  I hope that — that would be a phenomenal thing.\n",
      "\n",
      "But we have it right now in — approximately now, it’s increased to 1,500 people.  I spoke with Dr. Zucker in New York — terrific guy, by the way.  He’s — we’re doing a good job.  And I spoke to Governor Cuomo last evening and this morning about it.  So it’s been there for about three and a half days, but I think — and many other places it’s being tested too.  And we have a tremendous supply of it.  We’ve ordered it in the case that it works.  And it’s — it could have some pretty big impacts.  And we’ll see what happens.\n",
      "\n",
      "My administration is also working to get relief to American workers and businesses.  On day one of the Paycheck Protection Program, as Kevin said, more than $3.5. billion in guaranteed loans have been processed to help small businesses keep their workers employed during the unprecedented time — this unprecedented time.\n",
      "\n",
      "And Bank of America has been incredible.  Of the big banks, Bank of America has really stepped forward and done a great job. And then you have the community banks, your smaller banks.  And we’re already at $3.5 billion going out to incredible people.  But that’s way ahead of schedule.\n",
      "\n",
      "The SBA and the Treasury are working around the clock, and our banking partners are really incredible.  And they’re ensuring that the money gets to small businesses as quickly as possible, and then the small business, in turn, take care of employees that they would have had to let go, and now they’ll keep them.  And that’s good.  And then they’re going to open for business and they’re going to have their employees.  And we’ll try and get back to where we were.  Eventually, we’re going to supersede where we were.\n",
      "\n",
      "The energy industry has been especially hard hit in the crisis.  This afternoon, I met with Greg Garland of Phillips 66, Dave Hager of Devon Energy, Harold Hamm of Continental Resources, Jeff Hildebrand of Hilcorp Energy, Vicki Hollub of Occidental Petroleum, Mike Sommers of the American Petroleum Institute, Kelcy Warren of Energy Transfer Partners, Mike Wirth of Chevron, and Darren Woods of Exxon Mobil.  I informed them that we will be making space available in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to let American producers store surplus oil that can be sold at a later time.\n",
      "\n",
      "There’s a tremendous abundance of oil, primarily because of the virus.  The virus has just stopped demand of everything, including oil.  So we’re working with our great energy companies.  These are great companies.  They employ tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of people.  And they’ve kept America really going for a long time.  And no big price hikes, no big anything.  I mean, they’ve just kept it going.  And now they got hit.  But with all the jobs and all of the good that they do, we’re going to make sure that they stay in good shape.\n",
      "\n",
      "America is engaged in a historic battle to safeguard the lives of our citizens, our future society.  Our greatest weapon is the discipline and determination of every citizen to stay at home and stay healthy for a long time.  And we want them to stay healthy for a long time.  So stay at home.

      "Speaker: Donald J. Trump\n",
      "Words: I just had a meeting with Kevin McCarthy, future Speaker of the House, I hope. And he’s done a fantastic job for the people of California. And also, the people of California have done a fantastic job, when you look at the — at the bump. You take a look at the bump and how they’re doing out there. So I congratulate everybody out there.Thank you.  Great job you’re doing.Thank you.  You go ahead.  I’ll talk to you later. Okay, thank you very much, everybody.  And I want to start by saying that our hearts go out to the people of New York as they bear the brunt of the coronavirus pandemic in America.  That seems to be the hotspot right now.  But you have some others, as you know, that are very — very bad.  Very bad.  Louisiana is getting hit very hard.  Parts of Michigan are getting hit very, very hard.  New Jersey is — is –surprisingly, it’s much greater than anybody would have thought.  They’re doing a really good job.  The governor is doing a really good job out there.\n",
      "\n",
      "New York’s first responders, EMTs, doctors, nurses are showing incredible courage under pressure.  They’re the best in the world.  We will take every action and we’ll spare no resource — financial, medical, scientific.  We will not spare anything.  We’ll get it back into shape.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Empire State — the governor is doing an excellent job.  They’re all working very hard together.  At the request of the governor, as you know, the Javits Center, we have 2,500 beds, and we’re going to allow that to be a system where this horrible disease can be looked after, the patients can be looked after.  That was going to be for regular medical problems such as accidents.  And, you know, it’s very interesting, the governor is telling me we don’t have too many accidents and very few people driving.\n",
      "\n",
      "So we’re going to put that facility into play, which is a big facility.  The ship will be staying the way it is, but we’re putting that facility into play to help them.\n",
      "\n",
      "And today, also, the CDC is announcing additional steps Americans can take to defend against the transmission of the virus.  From recent studies, we know that the transmission from individuals without symptoms is playing a more significant role in the spread of the virus than previously understood.  So you don’t seem to have symptoms and it still gets transferred.\n",
      "\n",
      "In light of these studies, the CDC is advising the use of non-medical cloth face covering as an additional voluntary public health measure.  So it’s voluntary; you don’t have to do it.  They suggested for a period of time.  But this is voluntary.  I don’t think I’m going to be doing it.\n",
      "\n",
      "But you have a lot of ways — you can look at it as follows: The CDC is recommending that Americans wear a basic cloth or a fabric mask that can be either purchased online or simply made at home.  Probably material that you’d have at home.  These face coverings can be easily washed or reused.\n",
      "\n",
      "I want to emphasize that the CDC is not recommending the use of medical-grade or surgical-grade masks, and we want that to be used for our great medical people that are working so hard and doing some job.  Medical protective gear must be reserved for the frontline healthcare workers who are performing those vital services.\n",
      "\n",
      "The new mask guidelines also do not replace CDC’s guidance on social distancing, including staying in your home when possible, standing at least six feet apart for a period of time.  Again, we’re going to all come back together here.  We’re going to all come back together.  And practicing hand hygiene, which we should do anyway.\n",
      "\n",
      "A lot of things, I think, are going to spill over.  Shaking hands maybe will stay with our country for a long time beyond this.  One of the — one of our great doctors was telling me that — as you know, we have flus every year, and the number of people killed by the flu is very substantial.  And said that if they didn’t shake hands, that number would be substantially lower.  So maybe it’ll stay.  Maybe some of these things, long term, will be good.  But those guidelines are still the best and the safest way to avoid the infection.\n",
      "\n",
      "So with the masks, it’s going to be, really, a voluntary thing.  You can do it.  You don’t have to do it.  I’m choosing not to do it, but some people may want to do it, and that’s okay.  It may be good.  Probably will.  They’re making a recommendation.  It’s only a recommendation.  It’s voluntary.\n",
      "\n",
      "We’re also taking action to ensure the cost of no barrier to any American seeking testing or treatment of the coronavirus.  The largest insurer nationwide, the BlueCross BlueShield System, has now announced that it will not require any co-pays — which is really something; that’s a tremendous statement — from patients of the virus treatment for the next 60 days, similar to the commitments of Cigna, Humana, Anthem.  Those are great companies, and they’re all doing the same thing.  So, co-pays.  For them to do that is — it’s a big statement.  We appreciate it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Today I can so proudly announce that hospitals and healthcare providers treating uninsured coronavirus patients will be reimbursed by the federal government using funds from the economic relief package Congress passed last month.  So that was as per the question yesterday and actually the day before yesterday.  This should alleviate any concern uninsured Americans may have about seeking the coronavirus treatment.  So that’s, I think, answers the question pretty well and very much in the favor of our great people.\n",
      "\n",
      "I’m also signing a directive invoking the Defense Production Act to prohibit export of scarce health and medical supplies by unscrupulous actors and profiteers.\n",
      "\n",
      "The security and Secretary — the Secretary of Homeland Security will work with FEMA to prevent the export of N95 respirators, surgical masks, gloves, and other personal protective equipment.  We need these items immediately for domestic use.  We have to have them.  But we’ve done really well with the purchase of items, and you’ll be hearing about that shortly.\n",
      "\n",
      "We’ve already leveraged the DPA to stop the hoarding and price gouging of crucial supplies.  Under that authority, this week, the Department of Health and Human Services, working with the Department of Justice, took custody of nearly 200,000 N95 respirators, 130,000 surgical masks, 600,000 gloves, as well as bottles — many, many, many bottles — and disinfectant sprays that were being hoarded.  All of this material is now being given to healthcare workers.  Most of it has already been given out.  And we’ve given a lot to New York, a lot in New Jersey, a lot to other places.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to ensure that healthcare workers in New York have the protective equipment they need, the federal government, in the name of the Department of Defense, is providing about 8.1 million N95 respirators.  Department of Defense.  And we’ve already given 200,000 of them to New York City.  Mayor de Blasio needed them very badly, so we got them to Mayor de Blasio in New York City.  And they were very grateful.  8.1 million.  And we’re going to be increasing that number from 8.1 million to more.  That’s a lot of N95 respirators.\n",
      "\n",
      "Today, my team spoke with the CEO of Ochsner Health and the CEO of LCMC, the two largest health systems in New Orleans.  They said they feel that they currently have enough ventilators — I think a lot of people are going to have enough ventilators — and masks, and appreciate what we did and all of the things we’ve been doing with them, working with them.\n",
      "\n",
      "The CEO of Ochsner, Warner Thomas — who’s really been fantastic, I have to say — indicated a need for 230,000 surgical gowns.  And I instructed FEMA to deliver them tomorrow.  So they’ll have the 230,000.  That’s Louisiana — New Orleans.  Two hundred and thirty thousand surgical gowns; they’ll have them by tomorrow.\n",
      "\n",
      "We’re expanding the role of the armed forces in our response effort because no one is better prepared to win a war than the United States military.  And we are in a war.  The invisible enemy — remember.\n",
      "\n",
      "Over 9,000 retired Army medical personnel have answered their nation’s call and are now supporting field hospitals and medical facilities all across the country, like what I just told you, that Governor Cuomo requested we do something in Javits, where we take it over.  And we’re going to have that manned by the military, because it’s very tough to get people — more people in the New York area.  So we’re going to have it manned by the military — Javits Center.\n",
      "\n",
      "National Guard members have been activated to help states build new treatment centers and assist in the seamless distribution of medical supplies.  That includes National Guard.  The National Guard is assisting very strongly because the states were, in many cases, unable to have the delivery capability from warehouses and other places that we put the supplies.  So I’ve given approval to use the National Guards — the various National Guards in the different states.  And they’re doing a fantastic job of not only protecting people but delivering material.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Army Corps of Engineers has assessed more than 100 facilities in all 50 states and is rapidly building temporary hospitals and alternative care sites in many states: in New York, New Jersey, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Illinois, New Mexico, Oregon, Washington Wisconsin, Ohio.  They’re doing a lot of work in just those states, plus additionals, that are being — will be announced probably tomorrow.  But they’re doing some job.  The Army Corps of Engineers — what a job they’re doing.  And FEMA — what a job they’re doing.\n",
      "\n",
      "As we deploy the power of our military, we’re also deploying the skill of our doctors, scientists, and medical researchers.  We continue to study the effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine and other therapies, and the treatment and prevention of the virus.  And we will keep the American people fully informed on our findings.  Hydroxychloroquine — I don’t know, it’s looking like it’s having some good results.  I hope that — that would be a phenomenal thing.\n",
      "\n",
      "But we have it right now in — approximately now, it’s increased to 1,500 people.  I spoke with Dr. Zucker in New York — terrific guy, by the way.  He’s — we’re doing a good job.  And I spoke to Governor Cuomo last evening and this morning about it.  So it’s been there for about three and a half days, but I think — and many other places it’s being tested too.  And we have a tremendous supply of it.  We’ve ordered it in the case that it works.  And it’s — it could have some pretty big impacts.  And we’ll see what happens.\n",
      "\n",
      "My administration is also working to get relief to American workers and businesses.  On day one of the Paycheck Protection Program, as Kevin said, more than $3.5. billion in guaranteed loans have been processed to help small businesses keep their workers employed during the unprecedented time — this unprecedented time.\n",
      "\n",
      "And Bank of America has been incredible.  Of the big banks, Bank of America has really stepped forward and done a great job. And then you have the community banks, your smaller banks.  And we’re already at $3.5 billion going out to incredible people.  But that’s way ahead of schedule.\n",
      "\n",
      "The SBA and the Treasury are working around the clock, and our banking partners are really incredible.  And they’re ensuring that the money gets to small businesses as quickly as possible, and then the small business, in turn, take care of employees that they would have had to let go, and now they’ll keep them.  And that’s good.  And then they’re going to open for business and they’re going to have their employees.  And we’ll try and get back to where we were.  Eventually, we’re going to supersede where we were.\n",
      "\n",
      "The energy industry has been especially hard hit in the crisis.  This afternoon, I met with Greg Garland of Phillips 66, Dave Hager of Devon Energy, Harold Hamm of Continental Resources, Jeff Hildebrand of Hilcorp Energy, Vicki Hollub of Occidental Petroleum, Mike Sommers of the American Petroleum Institute, Kelcy Warren of Energy Transfer Partners, Mike Wirth of Chevron, and Darren Woods of Exxon Mobil.  I informed them that we will be making space available in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to let American producers store surplus oil that can be sold at a later time.\n",
      "\n",
      "There’s a tremendous abundance of oil, primarily because of the virus.  The virus has just stopped demand of everything, including oil.  So we’re working with our great energy companies.  These are great companies.  They employ tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of people.  And they’ve kept America really going for a long time.  And no big price hikes, no big anything.  I mean, they’ve just kept it going.  And now they got hit.  But with all the jobs and all of the good that they do, we’re going to make sure that they stay in good shape.\n",
      "\n",
      "America is engaged in a historic battle to safeguard the lives of our citizens, our future society.  Our greatest weapon is the discipline and determination of every citizen to stay at home and stay healthy for a long time.  And we want them to stay healthy for a long time.  So stay at home.  This is ending.  This will end.  You’ll see some bad things and then you’re going to see some really good things.  And it’s not going to be too long.\n",
      "\n",
      "We will heal our citizens and we will care for our neighbors, and we will unleash the full might of the United States of America to vanquish the virus.\n",
      "\n",
      "And with that, I’d like to ask Mike Pence to come up, Vice President, and say a few words.  And we’ll have a couple of other quick talks on a couple of subjects, and we’ll take questions.\n",
      "\n",
      "And it’s a beautiful Friday in Washington, D.C., and our country is a great place, and we’re getting better.  We’re getting better very quickly.\n",
      "\n",
      "This was artificially induced.  We just said — they said, “Close it down.  You have to close it down.”  We closed it down and we’re healing.  We’re going to get it better fast.\n",
